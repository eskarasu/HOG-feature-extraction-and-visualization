# HOG-feature-extraction-and-visualization
I added a Python script for Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction. This script reads an image, extracts HOG features, and visualizes both the original image and the HOG image. This is an important feature extraction technique used in image processing and machine learning applications.
